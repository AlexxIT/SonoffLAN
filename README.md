Home Assistant Custom Component for control **eWeLink** (Sonoff) devices over Local Network (LAN).

**Support only devices with firmware v3+**. LAN should support **Multicast** traffic.

Supporting firmware v2 **in development** ([read more](https://github.com/AlexxIT/SonoffLAN/issues/31)). Unfortunately I do not have such devices.

Pros:

- work with original eWeLink/Sonoff firmware, no need to flash devices
- work over local network (LAN), no Cloud Server dependency
- work with devices without DIY-mode
- work with devices in DIY-mode
- support single and multi-channel devices
- support TH and POW device attributes
- support Sonoff RF Bridge 433 for receive and send commands
- instant device state update with Multicast
- (optional) load devices list from eWeLink Servers (with names, apikey/devicekey and device_class) and save it locally
- (optional) change device type (switch, light or fan)
- (optional) set multi-channel device as one light with brightness control

**Component review from DrZzs (HOWTO about HACS)**

[![Component review from DrZzs](https://img.youtube.com/vi/DsTqOlrQQ1k/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsTqOlrQQ1k)

There is another great component by [@peterbuga](https://github.com/peterbuga/HASS-sonoff-ewelink), that works with cloud servers.

Thanks to these people [@beveradb](https://github.com/beveradb/sonoff-lan-mode-homeassistant), [@mattsaxon](https://github.com/mattsaxon/sonoff-lan-mode-homeassistant) for researching the local Sonoff protocol.

## Config Examples

Minimum config:

```yaml
sonoff:
  username: mymail@gmail.com
  password: mypassword
```

or

```yaml
sonoff:
  username: +910123456789  # important to use country code
  password: mypassword
```

Advanced config:

```yaml
sonoff:
  username: mymail@gmail.com
  password: mypassword
  reload: always  # update device list every time HA starts
  default_class: light  # changes the default class of all devices from switch to light
  devices:
    1000abcdefg:
      device_class: light  # changes the default class of the device from switch to light
```

Devices can be set manually, without connecting to Cloud Servers. But in this case, you need to know the `devicekey` for each device.

```yaml
sonoff:
  devices:
    1000abcdefg:
      devicekey: f9765c85-463a-4623-9cbe-8d59266cb2e4
```

Examples of using `device_class`:

```yaml
sonoff:
  username: mymail@gmail.com
  password: mypassword
  reload: once
  devices:
    1000abcde0: # corridor light
      device_class: light
    1000abcde1: # children's light (double switch, one light entity)
      device_class:
      - light: [1, 2]
    1000abcde2: # toilet light and fan (double switch)
      device_class: [light, fan]
    1000abcde3: # bedroom light and backlight (double switch)
      device_class: [light, light]
    1000abcde4: # hall three light zones Sonoff 4CH
      device_class:
      - light # zone 1 (channel 1)
      - light # zone 2 (channel 2)
      - light: [3, 4] # zone 3 (channels 3 and 4)
```

Minimum config for devices only in DIY mode:

```yaml
sonoff:
```

## Sonoff RF Bridge 433

**Video HOWTO from @KPeyanski**

Install from [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/), automation and event trigger:

[![Component review from DrZzs](https://img.youtube.com/vi/QD1K7s01cak/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD1K7s01cak?t=284)

Component will create only one entity per RF Bridge - `remote.sonoff_1000abcdefg`. Entity RF Buttons or RF Sensors are not created!

You can receive signals from RF Buttons and RF Sensors through an event `sonoff.remote`. And send signals using the service `remote.send_command`.

Although the component supports training, it is recommended to train RF Buttons through the eWeLink application.

When a command is received, the event `sonoff.remote` is generated with a button number and response time (in UTC, sends the device).

`command` - number of the button in the eWeLink application.

Example for receive RF signal via [Automation](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/automation/):

```yaml
automation:
- alias: Receive RF Button1
  trigger:
    platform: event
    event_type: sonoff.remote
    event_data:
      name: Button1  # button/sensor name in eWeLink application
  action:
    service: homeassistant.toggle
    entity_id: switch.sonoff_1000abcdefg
```

Example for send RF signal via [Script](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/script/):

```yaml
script:
  send_button1:
    alias: Send RF Button1
    sequence:
    - service: remote.send_command
      data:
        entity_id: remote.sonoff_1000abcdefg
        command: Button1  # button name in eWeLink application
```

## Sonoff TH Ð¸ Pow

Temperature, humidity and other parameters of the devices are stored in their attributes. They can be displayed through [Template](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/)-sensor.

```yaml
sensor:
- platform: template
  sensors:
    temperature_purifier:
      friendly_name: Temperature
      device_class: temperature
      value_template: "{{ state_attr('switch.sonoff_1000abcdefg', 'temperature') }}"
    humidity_purifier:
      friendly_name: Humidity
      device_class: humidity
      value_template: "{{ state_attr('switch.sonoff_1000abcdefg', 'humidity') }}"
```

## Parameters:

- **reload** - *optional*  
  `always` - load device list every time HA starts  
  `once` - (default) download device list once
- **default_class** - *optional*, default `switch`, overrides default device type of all devices
- **device_class** - *optional*, overrides device type (default all **sonoff** devices are displayed as `default_class`). May be a string or an array of strings (for multi-channel switches). Supports types: `light`, `fan`, `switch`, `remote` (only for *Sonoff RF Bridge 433*).


## Work with Cloud Servers

With `username` and` password` in the config (optional) - component loads list of devices from eWeLink Servers and save it in the file `/config/.sonoff.json` (hidden file).

The component does not make other requests to servers.

The list will be loaded only once. At the next start, the list will be loaded from the local file. When you have new **eWeLink** devices - manually delete the file and reboot the HA.

With `reload: always` in the config - the list will be loaded from servers at each start.

The list will be loaded from the local file even if you remove `username` and `password` from the settings.

## Getting devicekey manually

1. Put the device in setup mode
2. Connect to the Wi-Fi network `ITEAD-10000`, password` 12345678`
3. Open in browser `http://10.10.7.1/device`
4. Copy `deviceid` and `apikey` (this is `devicekey`)
5. Connect to your Wi-Fi network and setup Sonoff via the eWeLink app

## Demo

**Sonoff 4CH Pro R2**, configured as a single light source with brightness control.

## HACS Support

![Support HACS](hacs.png)

## Common problems

**Devices are not displayed**

1. Currently only supported devices with firmware v3+
2. Common problems with Multicast:
   - two routers
   - docker with port forwarding
   - virtual machine with port forwarding
   - virtualbox
   - linux firewall
   - linux network driver

## Component Debugging

Add to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.sonoff: debug
```

Only devices with firmware 3 and higher are supported.

All unknown devices with command `switch` support will be added as `switch`.

All other unknown devices will be added as `binary_sensor` (always `off`). The full state of the device is displayed in its attributes.

The component adds the service `sonoff.send_command` to send low-level commands.

Example service params to single switch:

```yaml
device: 1000123456
command: switch
switch: 'on'
```

Example service params to multi-channel switch:

```yaml
device: 1000123456
command: switches
switches: [{outlet: 0, switch: 'off'}]
```

Example service params to dimmer:

```yaml
device: 1000123456
command: dimmable
switch: 'on'
brightness: 50
mode: 0
```
